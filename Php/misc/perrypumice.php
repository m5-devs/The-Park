							Story
						</h5>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perry Pumice was born in a bang. He and his siblings were flung out of the volcano and quickly cooled. When he finally opened his eyes there were many of his siblings lying on the ground around him. A few minutes later Perry couldnâ€™t see anymore because he was covered by his siblings.<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later he started seeing light coming through the others. A few seconds later he saw the sky and some weird creatures lifting up his siblings and putting them on weird four legged things. Suddenly Perry was also picked up and put on the weird four legged thing. He traveled in this four legged thing for a few hours alongside his siblings before being dumped into a container with the others.<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the others stayed inside this container for a while. In this container he met many new friends. Among these were Paige, Patrick, Pablo and Pixie Pumice. He also met a beautiful rock named Pamela, who he fell in love with at first sight. The only problem with Pamela was that she suffered from worse gas than all others from the Pumice clan. But this did not matter to Perry and he decided to marry her anyways. A few days after their wedding Paige and a few others were moved into a new container labeled Pumice Hair Remover. Over the next few days others got moved as well, Patrick to a container labeled Concrete, Pablo to a container labeled Pencil Erasers, and Pixie to a container labeled Toilet Cleaner. Perry and Pamela were starting to feel scared that they were going to be separated since all of their friends had been moved to another place and then the flood came.<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lake Perry and Pamela were bobbing on the surface and were slowly drifting away from each other when Perry and Pamela got picked up by one of the big weird hairless creatures. They were both ever so grateful that they were still together until one of the creatures picked up Perry and started rubbing him against some wood. When Perry finally got back to Pamela part of his body was missing. Everyday this process continued until one day Perry never came back.
